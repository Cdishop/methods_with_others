Methods With Others in Mind: Cooperative Tools and Workflow

 

When graduate students and faculty reach for tools to conduct good science, they often draw from a toolkit which they created during their traditional methods coursework (e.g., regression, structural equations modeling, research design and measurement). Many then view "research methods" as a bucket that contains (a) a set of statistical models and (b) knowledge of designs and the philosophy of science – all of which are useful but removed from the day-to-day experience of what it's like to conduct a project. My talk will describe why two underemphasized tools – programming and data management – are necessary to add to your toolkit because they promote productivity and cooperation – they put you in a position to be more productive and helpful, both to your peers and yourself. For some graduate students, the closest experience they receive to the idea of proper data management and workflow is when their stats professor says something like, "It's probably smart for you to save your SPSS syntax so that when you re-run an analysis you can do it faster." That idea is on point, but there are many other benefits to cover. My talk will describe them.
