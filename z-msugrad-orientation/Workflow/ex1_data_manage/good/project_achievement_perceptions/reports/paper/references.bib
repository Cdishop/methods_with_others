  abstract = {Organizational scientists must capitalize on the big data revolution to better understand the nomothetic, idiographic, multilevel, and/or dynamic processes that make up today’s workplace. Simultaneously, researchers must collect high-quality data and be careful, diligent, and deliberate during data wrangling and data analysis so that all results can be replicated and all inferences are appropriate. Unfortunately, big data create many uncommon challenges during data acquisition and data wrangling that must be considered and overcome to fulfill the promise and potential of big data. Specifically, during acquisition, organizational scientists must become familiar with concepts like web scraping and databases, determine how to divide big data files into manageable chunks for cleaning and analysis, all while ensuring not to violate data usage rules and regulations. Likewise, once acquired, to effectively wrangle data so that they are ready for analysis researchers must be able to handle multiple file formats and data encoding standards, utilize a variety of software to visualize and diagnose data structure, and be adept at using functions and algorithms to determine variable structure and evaluate records and variables for missing or erroneous information. The current article provides a concise definition of big data and addresses each of these novel challenges and concepts related to big data acquisition and wrangling, specifically focusing on providing guidance and recommendations. Finally, a detailed big data example, team development using play-by-play basketball data, is provided. Each step of the process of scraping the data from the web as well as wrangling the multilevel big data into tidy data form is discussed, accompanied by a supplemental R file that contains all of the code necessary for researchers to replicate the described procedure.},

  abstract = {Organizational scientists increasingly focus on the dynamics of human behavior through longitudinal and event sampling methodologies. Random coefficient modeling such as hierarchical linear modeling and latent growth modeling is the dominant analytical method for longitudinal data. These models require that the covariance matrix of the errors is time invariant. Unfortunately, if unmeasured or unpredictable influences (i.e., unmeasured variables) consistently impact the dynamic process under investigation, the error term can become time-dependent. If random coefficient modeling is used to analyze data with time-dependent errors, then a serious inflation of Type I error rates, known as spurious regression, is observed. Monte Carlo simulation results from several common random coefficient models are presented to highlight the scope and severity of the problem, focusing on the potential mistaken inferences researchers can make. An analytic strategy is proposed to aid researchers in determining the underlying structure of the error covariance matrix, and alternative statistical techniques are given to analyze data that may contain a time-dependent error term.},

These assumptions influence the nature of theoretical constructs and propositions and should, ideally, also influence data collection, analysis, and interpretation.

We used semistructured interviews with 38 new-product team managers in high-technology companies, log data from two of these teams, and questionnaires completed by members of a different set of 45 new-product teams to generate and test hypotheses about teams' external activities. Results indicate that teams engage in vertical communications aimed at molding the views of top management, horizontal communication aimed at coordinating work and obtaining feedback, and horizontal communication aimed at general scanning of the technical and market environment. Organizational teams appear to develop distinct strategies toward their environment: some specialize in particular external activities, some remain isolated from the external environment, and others engage in multiple external activities. The paper shows that the type of external communication teams engage in, not just the amount, determines performance. Over time, teams following a comprehensive strategy enter positive cycles of external activity, internal processes, and performance that enable long-term team success.},

Essential to the development of our model is the concept of organization-environment (O-E) temporal fit, which is a state of synchronization or alignment of organization and environment activity cycles. O-E temporal fit is positioned as an important contingency element because temporal misfit implies inefficiencies, substandard performance, and the potential death of the organization over time.

Several special circumstances with regard to leadership are first considered, including the varied domains in which leadership is relevant, its multilevel nature, the multiple sources of origin for leadership, and the multiple outcomes in terms of leader emergence and effectiveness. Various leadership theories and frameworks are then reviewed, organized around classical theories (evolutionary, trait, behavior, and contingency), bridging theories (charismatic/transformational, leader-member exchange, and leadership perceptions), and emerging approaches (team, shared, and capacity approaches). Future directions in terms of leadership theory, research, and practice are proposed, concluding with a summary of what I-O psychologists know about leadership and speculation as to what has yet to be learned.},

We introduce two classes of identity management strategies individuals use to mitigate the negative consequences of discrimination: identity switching (i.e., deemphasizing target identities and recategorizing to a more positively valued identity) and identity redeﬁnition (i.e., stereotype reassociation and regeneration). Organizations adopting a color-blind approach may make it more difﬁcult for individuals to use identity switching because the policies deemphasize differences in social identities. In contrast, organizations adopting a multicultural approach may make it more difﬁcult for individuals to use identity redeﬁnition. Multicultural approaches, applied superﬁcially, may celebrate group differences that might actually reinforce culturally dominant stereotypes. We explore the likelihood that individuals will adopt each strategy given these organizational approaches to diversity. We outline steps organizations can take to reduce the need for identity management strategies and to facilitate identity management when necessary.},

The present study adds to the literature by examining a key individual difference variable in the perception of discrimination at work, namely individual color-blind attitudes. We examined relationships between 3 dimensions of color-blind attitudes (Racial Privilege, Institutional Discrimination, and Blatant Racial Issues) and perceptions of racial microaggressions in the workplace as enacted by a White supervisor toward a Black employee (i.e., discriminatory actions ranging from subtle to overt). Findings showed that observer views on institutional discrimination fully mediated, and blatant racial issues partially mediated, the relationships between racial group membership and the perception of workplace microaggressions. Non-Hispanic Whites endorsed color blindness as institutional discrimination and blatant racial issues significantly more than members of racioethnic minority groups, and higher levels of color-blind worldviews were associated with lower likelihoods of perceiving microaggressions. Views on racial privilege did not differ significantly between members of different racial groups or affect microaggression perceptions. Implications for organizations concerned about promoting more inclusive workplaces are discussed.},

Using the data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS; National Center for Educational Statistics [NCES], 2013), the present study examines the relationship between women’s representation in university top administration and faculty positions and the 2 main areas of Title IX compliance among the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institutions: passing the ﬁrst prong of the “substantial proportionality” test and women’s share of total per team expenditures. The ﬁndings indicate that while women’s representation in top administrative positions does not explain the institution’s Title IX compliance, their representation in pretenure faculty positions is positively, though weakly, associated with compliance in terms of women’s share of per-team expenditure. The results also suggest that the representation of women in state legislatures is positively associated with Title IX compliance of public institutions, but not with private institutions’ compliance.},

I consider these efforts through the lens of ﬁve approaches to diversity, which illuminate the complex, multifaceted tactics utilized in various phases and contexts of the 20-year effort. Activists primarily used identity-aware approaches and harmonious diversity approaches. The article provides insight into the inﬂuence of identity, ressentiment, and intergroup coalitions in seeking these policy changes. In particular, the study provides researchers, activists, and other practitioners with evidence demonstrating the successful use of different approaches to diversity. These ﬂexible approaches were used in response to varying organizational contexts throughout this long-term organization change effort. Despite the tension that arose among activists in determining which approach to use, the deliberative and ﬂexible use of these approaches resulted in a well-respected and generally successful effort.},

A pilot study has been performed in order to investigate the relationship between diversity perceptions and organizational performance perceptions by making use of the diversity typology set out by Harrison and Klein (2007) based on variety, separation, and disparity. However, this pilot study has several limitations and more advanced research needs to be conducted in order to show how diversity types can have different effects. The data were gathered by means of a questionnaire ﬁlled out by managers from various Dutch organizations (N ϭ 291). The pilot study showed that employee diversity can have different effects in an organization depending on how this diversity is considered; for example, employee diversity considered as levels of status may have a negative effect, while employee diversity considered as different levels of expertise can have a positive effect. The way diversity is perceived by managers in an organizational setting can have important relations with how organizational performance is perceived by those managers. The paper implies to show that employee diversity can have a variety of effects in the workplace depending on how employee diversity is considered. This knowledge may help to increase positive effects of diversity in the workplace when managers need to deal with diversity and improve organizational outcomes.},

The current article reviews 3 popular approaches to the measurement of diversity: the simplistic majority–minority approach and 2 multiple categories variants, the generalized variance and the lesser used entropy statistic. We discuss the properties of each approach and reject the majority–minority approach. We provide 5 examples using the generalized variance and entropy statistics and illustrate their versatility and flexibility. We urge investigators to adopt these multicategory measures and to use our discussion to determine which measure of diversity is most appropriate given the nature of one’s data set and research question.},

Even though diversity, especially diversity of perspectives and knowledge, is frequently argued to stimulate higher creativity in teams, empirical findings on this relationship remain inconsistent. We have developed a theoretical model in which the effect of a team’s diversity on its creativity is moderated by the degree to which team members engage in perspective taking. We propose that perspective taking helps realize the creative benefits of diversity of perspectives by fostering information elaboration. Results of a laboratory experiment support the hypothesized interaction between diversity and perspective taking on team creativity. Diverse teams performed more creatively than homogeneous teams when they engaged in perspective taking, but not when they were not instructed to take their team members’ perspectives. Team information elaboration was found to mediate this moderated effect and was associated with a stronger indirect effect than mere information sharing or task conflict. Our results point to perspective taking as an important mechanism to unlock diversity’s potential for team creativity.},

  abstract = {Summary) Self-categorization theory proposes that people may use social characteristics such as age, race, or organizational membership to define psychological groups and to promote a positive self-identity. This theory is used to develop and test hypotheses about the effects of demographic diversity in organizations on an individual's psychological and behavioral attachment to the organization. Individual-level commitment, attendance behavior, and tenure intentions are examined as a function of the individual's degree of difference from others on such social categories as age, tenure, education, sex, and race. Analyses of a sample of 151 groups comprising 1,705 repsondents showed that increasing work-unit diversity was associated with lower levels of psychological attachment among group members. Nonsymmetrical effects were found for sex and race, with whites and men showing larger negative effects for increased unit heterogeneity than nonwhites and women.},

Utilizing a controlled experiment and a hypothetical organization, Study 1 revealed that both Blacks and Whites spent more time viewing recruitment websites and better recalled website information when the sites included racial diversity cues. These relationships were stronger for Blacks, and organizational attractiveness perceptions mediated these effects for Blacks but not for Whites. Study 2 found similar relationships for Black and White participants viewing real organizational recruitment websites after taking into account perceived organizational attributes and website design effects.

Participants were randomly assigned to be given additional information about job-relatedness and affirmative action procedures or not (egalitarian norms), and were then told they would or would not have to explain their ratings (accountability). Consistent with aversive discrimination theory, participants rated the gay applicant less positively than the nongay applicant irrespective of self-reported and implicit heterosexist attitudes. Bias favoring the heterosexual applicant was found in the no accountability condition but no differences were seen between the gay and nongay applicant in the accountability condition. Our study did not find support of the effect of training focusing on egalitarian norms on bias in ratings. Organizations should recognize the potential bias that targets gay applicants and consider methods to incorporate accountability in order to mitigate discriminatory hiring practices.},

Furthermore, this illusory sense of fairness derived from the mere presence of diversity structures causes high-status group members to legitimize the status quo by becoming less sensitive to discrimination targeted at underrepresented groups and reacting more harshly toward underrepresented group members who claim discrimination. Six experiments support these hypotheses in designs using 4 types of diversity structures (diversity policies, diversity training, diversity awards, idiosyncratically generated diversity structures from participants’ own organizations) among 2 high-status groups in tests involving several types of discrimination (discriminatory promotion practices, adverse impact in hiring, wage discrimination).

Interestingly, however, the previously reported effects of diversity training are often weak and, sometimes, even negative. This situation calls for research on the conditions under which diversity training helps or harms teams. We propose that diversity training can increase team creativity, but only for teams with less positive pretraining diversity beliefs (i.e., teams with a greater need for such training) and that are sufficiently diverse in nationality. Comparing the creativity of teams that attended nationality diversity training versus control training, we found that for teams with less positive diversity beliefs, diversity training increased creative performance when the team’s nationality diversity was high, but undermined creativity when the team’s nationality diversity was low. Diversity training had less impact on teams with more positive diversity beliefs, and training effects were not contingent upon these teams’ diversity. Speaking to the underlying process, we showed that these interactive effects were driven by the experienced team efficacy of the team members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for nationality diversity management.},

  abstract = {Self-regulation and learning are fundamentally dynamic phenomena that occur at the within-person level and unfold over time. However, the majority of the extant empirical research on self-regulated learning has been conducted at the between-person level, which can obscure the true nature of interrelationships among self-regulatory mechanisms. In the present study, we seek to advance a more nuanced view of the role of self-regulation in modern training and development by presenting a novel theoretical perspective that integrates cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms central to the literature on active learning with the more dynamic theoretical principles and mechanisms underlying stage-based cognitive models of skill acquisition. Hypotheses derived from this model were tested in a laboratory study with 305 participants who practiced a dynamic computer game involving strong cognitive and perceptual-motor demands. Bivariate cross-lagged latent growth models generally supported the proposed model, revealing systematic trends over the course of practice consistent with a series of iterative, bidirectional, and self-correcting reciprocal interrelationships among self-efficacy, metacognition, exploratory behavior, and practice performance. Collectively, these findings suggest that strong positive interrelationships among self-regulated learning variables at the between-person level may, in some cases, actually belie the true nature of their functional effects. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Theories are the core of any science, but many imprecisely stated theories in organizational and management science are hampering progress in the field. Computational modeling of existing theories can help address the issue. Computational models are a type of formal theory that are represented mathematically or by other formal logic and can be simulated, allowing theorists to assess whether the theory can explain the phenomena intended as well as make testable predictions. As an example of the process, Locke’s integrated model of work motivation is translated into static and dynamic computational models. Simulations of these models are compared to the empirical data used to develop and test the theory. For the static model, the simulations revealed largely strong associations with robust empirical findings. However, adding dynamics created several challenges to key precepts of the theory. Moreover, the effort revealed where empirical work is needed to further refine or refute the theory. Discussion focuses on the value of computational modeling as a method for formally testing, pruning, and extending extant theories in the field.},

  abstract = {Despite the lengthy history of team cohesion-performance research, little is known about their reciprocal relationships over time. Using meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 17 CLP design studies, and analyze their results using SEM. Results support that team cohesion and performance are related reciprocally with each other over time. We then used longitudinal data from 205 members of 57 student teams who competed in a complex business simulation over 10 weeks, to test: (a) whether team cohesion and performance were related reciprocally over multiple time periods, (b) the relative magnitude of those relationships, and (c) whether they were stable over time. We also considered the influence of team members' academic competence and degree of shared leadership on these dynamics. As anticipated, cohesion and performance were related positively, and reciprocally, over time. However, the cohesion [arrow right] performance relationship was significantly higher than the performance [arrow right] cohesion relationship. Moreover, the cohesion [arrow right] performance relationship grew stronger over time whereas the performance [arrow right] cohesion relationship remained fairly consistent over time. As expected, shared leadership related positively to team cohesion but not directly to their performance; whereas average team member academic competence related positively to team performance but was unrelated to team cohesion. Finally, we conducted and report a replication using a second sample of students competing in a business simulation. Our earlier substantive relationships were mostly replicated, and we illustrated the dynamic temporal properties of shared leadership. We discuss these findings in terms of theoretical importance, applied implications, and directions for future research.},

On the basis of longitudinal, multi-informant and multisource data from public hospital services in England, we provide new insights into the complex interplay between employees’ perceptions of HR systems, job satisfaction, and performance outcomes over time. The dynamic panel data analyses provide support for changes in employees’ experience of an HR system being related to subsequent changes in customer satisfaction, as mediated by changes in job satisfaction, albeit these effects decrease over time. Moreover, our longitudinal analyses highlight the importance of feedback effects in the HRM–performance chain, which otherwise appears to evolve in a cyclical manner.

The application of these models to longitudinal data assumes that the data-generating mechanism behind the psychological process under investigation contains only a deterministic trend. However, if a process, at least partially, contains a stochastic trend, then random coefficient regression results are likely to be spurious. This problem is demonstrated via a data example, previous research on simple regression models, and Monte Carlo simulations. A data analytic strategy is proposed to help researchers avoid making inaccurate inferences when observed trends may be due to stochastic processes.

  abstract = {Employees help on a regular daily basis while at work, yet surprisingly little is known about how responding to help requests affects helpers. Although recent theory suggests that helping may come at a cost to the helper, the majority of the helping literature has focused on the benefits of helping. The current study addresses the complex nature of helping by simultaneously considering its costs and benefits for helpers. Using daily diary data across 3 consecutive work weeks, we examine the relationship between responding to help requests, perceived prosocial impact of helping, and helpers' regulatory resources. We find that responding to help requests depletes regulatory resources at an increasing rate, yet perceived prosocial impact of helping can replenish resources. We also find that employees' prosocial motivation moderates these within-person relationships, such that prosocial employees are depleted to a larger extent by responding to help requests, and replenished to a lesser extent by the perceived prosocial impact of helping. Understanding the complex relationship of helping with regulatory resources is important because such resources have downstream effects on helpers' behavior in the workplace. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/journals/apl/101/8/1097/]},

  abstract = {A review of recent models of organizational commitment and turnover indicated that the causal relation between job satisfaction and organizational commitment had been overlooked and that attempts to identify the antecedents of these variables had suffered from conceptual and methodological limitations. These 2 issues were examined by means of a structural equation methodology that was used to reanalyze data from Michaels and Spector (1982) and Bluedorn (1982). Four causal models were investigated. Across the samples, support was obtained for relations between personal/organizational characteristics and job satisfaction, and between satisfaction and commitment. Commitment was found to be an important determinant of turnover intentions. The results of the study present a challenge to previous models and research investigating commitment and turnover. Present research suggests that personal characteristics, work experiences, job characteristics, organizational factors, and role-related factors may influence commitment only indirectly.},

Data from 2 published studies from the job satisfaction and organizational commitment literature were reanalyzed by LVM. The consequence of specifying residual correlations were examined for models containing nonlagged and lagged reciprocal effects. The results of model comparison tests in both samples supported the importance of specifying correlations among the residuals, and many of the residual correlations were statistically significant. Moreover, specifying residual correlations resulted in most of the significant parameter estimates representing reciprocal effects becoming nonsignificant. Changes in other parameter estimates also occurred.},

We offer advice and illustrative examples to guide future research, and provide recommendations for gaining access to organizations to open doors for collaborating on quasi-experiments.},

When the gill-withdrawal reflex was repeatedly evoked by a tactile stimulus to the siphon or mantle shelf, the amplitude of the response showed marked decrement (habituation). After a period of rest the response showed spontaneous recovery. The amplitude of a habituated response was facilitated by the presentation of a strong tactile stimulus to another part of the animal (dishabituation). Many characteristics of habituation and dishabituation in Aplysia are similar to those in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {This study examined factors that influence the dynamic pursuit of multiple goals over time. As hypothesized, goal-performance discrepancies were significantly related to subsequent time allocation. Greater distance from a given goal resulted in greater time subsequently allocated to that goal. In addition, the incentives offered for goal attainment determined the relative influence of discrepancies for each goal. When the incentives for each goal were equivalent, progress toward each goal exhibited equal influence, with greater time allocated to whichever goal was furthest from completion at the time. However, with an incentive available for only 1 of the 2 goals, time allocation was largely determined by progress toward the rewarded goal. Likewise, when incentives for each task differed in their approach-avoidance framing, progress toward the avoidance-framed goal was a stronger predictor of subsequent allocation than was progress toward the approach-framed goal. Finally, the influence of goal-performance discrepancies differed as a function of the time remaining for goal pursuit. The implications for future work on dynamic goal prioritization and the provision of performance incentives are discussed.

They discuss affect as antecedent, consequence, and content of goals and argue for integrating across psychological content areas to study goal-directed cognition and action more efficiently. They emphasize the structural and dynamic aspects of pursuing multiple goals, parallel processing, and the parsimony provided by the goal construct. Finally, they advocate construct validation of a taxonomy of goals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

In this review, I discuss several recent theories and measures of context. The added value of a contextual approach is illustrated by how context can shape personality, how it affects the emergence of work designs, and how it benefits the study of organizational demography. Future research topics include context cue sensitivity, the way context is shaped, the mediators of context effects, and the breadth and limits of contextual impact. A recurrent theme is that although context enables a demarcation of what is distinctive about situations, it also permits integration across research areas and levels of analysis, identifying what they have in common as settings for organizational behavior.},

Here we derive a formula for the bias of the Least-Squares Dummy Variable (LSDV) estimator which has a O(N -’ T -312) approximation error. In a simulation study this is found to be remarkably accurate. Due to the small variance of the LSDV estimator, which is usually much smaller than the v,ariance of consistent (Generalized) Method of Moments estimators, a very efficient procedure results when we remove the bias from the LSDV estimator. The simulations contain results for a particular operational corrected LSDV estimation procedure which in many situations proves to be (much) more efficient than various instrumental variable type estimators.},

  abstract = {Although goal pursuit is related to both functioning of the brain’s reward circuits and psychological factors, the literatures surrounding these concepts have often been separate. Here, we use the psychological construct of regulatory focus to investigate individual differences in neural response to reward. Regulatory focus theory proposes two motivational orientations for personal goal pursuit: (1) promotion, associated with sensitivity to potential gain, and (2) prevention, associated with sensitivity to potential loss. The monetary incentive delay task was used to manipulate reward circuit function, along with instructional framing corresponding to promotion and prevention in a within-subject design. We observed that the more promotion oriented an individual was, the lower their ventral striatum response to gain cues. Follow-up analyses revealed that greater promotion orientation was associated with decreased ventral striatum response even to no-value cues, suggesting that promotion orientation may be associated with relatively hypoactive reward system function. The findings are also likely to represent an interaction between the cognitive and motivational characteristics of the promotion system with the task demands. Prevention orientation did not correlate with ventral striatum response to gain cues, supporting the discriminant validity of regulatory focus theory. The results highlight a dynamic association between individual differences in self-regulation and reward system function.},

  abstract = {Higgins' (2000) theory of regulatory fit proposes that motivational strength will be enhanced when the manner in which people work toward a goal sustains (rather than disrupts) their regulatory orientation. This enhanced motivational strength in turn should improve efforts at goal attainment. In Experiment 1, predominantly promotion- and prevention-focused participants were given the goal of writing a report on their leisure time, and were assigned either eagerness- or vigilance-framed means to use. Promotion/eagerness and prevention/vigilance participants were about 50\% more likely to turn in their reports than promotion/vigilance and prevention/eagerness participants. In Experiment 2, participants read either a promotion- or a prevention-framed health message urging them to eat more fruits and vegetables, and were then asked to imagine either the benefits of compliance or the costs of non-compliance. Promotion/benefits and prevention/costs participants subsequently ate about 20\% more fruits and vegetables over the following week than promotion/costs and prevention/benefits participants. The implications of regulatory fit's enhancement of motivational strength are discussed. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These predictions are generated and maintained as people update their beliefs more readily when receiving information that calls for adjustment in an optimistic direction relative to information that calls for adjustment in a pessimistic direction. Thus far this update bias has been shown when people make estimations regarding the self. Here, we examine whether asymmetric belief updating also exists when making estimations regarding population base rates. We reveal that while participants update beliefs regarding risk in the population in an asymmetric manner, such valence-dependent updating of base rates can be accounted for by priors. In contrast, we show that optimistic updating regarding the self is a robust phenomenon, which holds even under different empirical definitions of desirable information.},

  shorttitle = {Valence-{{Dependent Belief Updating}}},
  abstract = {People tend to update beliefs about their future outcomes in a valence-dependent way: they are likely to incorporate good news and to neglect bad news. However, belief formation is a complex process which depends not only on motivational factors such as the desire for favorable conclusions, but also on multiple cognitive variables such as prior beliefs, knowledge about personal vulnerabilities and resources, and the size of the probabilities and estimation errors. Thus, we applied computational modeling in order to test for valence-induced biases in updating while formally controlling for relevant cognitive factors. We compared biased and unbiased Bayesian models of belief updating, and specified alternative models based on reinforcement learning. The experiment consisted of 80 trials with 80 different adverse future life events. In each trial, participants estimated the base rate of one of these events and estimated their own risk of experiencing the event before and after being confronted with the actual base rate. Belief updates corresponded to the difference between the two self-risk estimates. Valence-dependent updating was assessed by comparing trials with good news (better-than-expected base rates) with trials with bad news (worse-than-expected base rates). After receiving bad relative to good news, participants’ updates were smaller and deviated more strongly from rational Bayesian predictions, indicating a valence-induced bias. Model comparison revealed that the biased (i.e., optimistic) Bayesian model of belief updating better accounted for data than the unbiased (i.e., rational) Bayesian model, confirming that the valence of the new information influenced the amount of updating. Moreover, alternative computational modeling based on reinforcement learning demonstrated higher learning rates for good than for bad news, as well as a moderating role of personal knowledge. Finally, in this specific experimental context, the approach based on reinforcement learning was superior to the Bayesian approach. The computational validation of valence-dependent belief updating represents a novel support for a genuine optimism bias in human belief formation. Moreover, the precise control of relevant cognitive variables justifies the conclusion that the motivation to adopt the most favorable self-referential conclusions biases human judgments.},

How people maintain unrealistic optimism, despite frequently encountering information that challenges those biased beliefs, is unknown. Here, we provide an explanation. Specifically, we show a striking asymmetry, whereby people updated their beliefs more in response to information that was better than expected compared to information that was worse. This selectivity was mediated by a relative failure to code for errors that should reduce optimism. Distinct regions of the prefrontal cortex tracked estimation errors when those called for positive update, both in highly optimistic and low optimistic individuals. However, highly optimistic individuals exhibited reduced tracking of estimation errors that called for negative update within right inferior prefrontal gyrus. These findings show that optimism is tied to a selective update failure, and diminished neural coding, of undesirable information regarding the future.},

  abstract = {Although experiencing unfairness is a primary source of stress, there are surprisingly few studies that have examined the physiological underpinnings of unfairness. Drawing from social self-preservation theory, we derive predictions regarding the effects of interactional unfairness on activity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which is one of the body’s primary hormonal systems for responding to stress. Using an experimental design with objective physiological measures, we found support for our hypothesis that interactional unfairness triggers the release of cortisol by the HPA axis. This cortisol activity in turn mediated the effects of interactional unfairness on deviant behavior. This indirect effect remained significant after controlling for established attitudinal and self-construal mediators of the justice– deviance relationship. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for the occupational stress and organizational justice literatures.},

Next, we delineate the situational cues in organizational settings that can exacerbate stereotype threat, and explain how and why these cues affect stereotyped individuals. Finally, we discuss relatively simple empirically based strategies that organizations can implement to reduce stereotype threat and create conditions in which employees and applicants from all groups can succeed.},

  abstract = {Self-regulation at work is conceived in terms of within-person processes that occur over time. These processes are proposed to occur within a hierarchical framework of negative feedback systems that operate at different levels of abstraction and with different time cycles. Negative feedback systems respond to discrepancies in a manner that reduces deviations from standards (i.e., goals). This is in contrast to positive feedback systems in which discrepancies are created, which can lead to instability. We organize our discussion around four hierarchical levels—self, achievement task, lower-level task action, and knowledge/working memory. We theorize that these levels are loosely connected by multiple constraints and that both automatic and more conscious processes are essential to self-regulation. Within- and cross-level affective and cognitive processes interact within this system to motivate goal-related behaviors while also accessing needed knowledge and protecting current intentions from interference. Complications common in the work setting (as well as other complex, real-life settings) such as the simultaneous pursuit of multiple goals, the importance of knowledge access and expertise, and team and multiperson processes are also discussed. Finally, we highlight the usefulness of newer research methodologies and data-analytic techniques for examining such hierarchical, dynamic, within-person processes.},

The current research investigates whether perceptions of LMX variability (the extent to which LMX relationships are perceived to vary within a team) affects employee job satisfaction and wellbeing beyond the effects of personal LMX quality. As LMX variability runs counter to principles of equality and consistency, which are important for maintaining social harmony in groups, it is hypothesized that perceptions of LMX variability will have a negative effect on employee reactions, via its negative impact on perceived team relations. Two samples of employed individuals were used to investigate the hypothesized relationships. In both samples, an individual's perception of LMX variability in their team was negatively related to employee job satisfaction and wellbeing (above the effects of LMX), and this relationship was mediated by reports of relational team conflict.},

  shorttitle = {Suggestions for {{Studying Strategy Process}}},
  abstract = {This paper makes three suggestions to researchers for studying strategy process. First, define the meaning of process. Process is often used in three ways in the literature: (1) a logic used to explain a causal relationship in a variance theory, (2) a category of concepts that refer to actions of individuals or organizations, and (3) a sequence of events that describe how things change over time. The second suggestion is to clarify the theory of process. An interdisciplinary literature review identifies four types of theories of process that can be drawn upon: life cycle, teleology, dialectics, and evolution. The third suggestion is to design research to observe strategy process in such a way that is consistent with one's definition and theory of process.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the relationships of attitudes and behavior to characteristics of departments, positions, and individuals for 271 employees in nineteen departments of two organizations. This study also considers whether job characteristics are potential mediators in these relationships. Once a month for four months, the 271 employees completed identical forms of a questionnaire in which they describe their jobs, their positions within their organizations, their values, and their responses to work. Company records yielded monthly absenteeism data. Measures of department structure and technology were derived from company records and interviews. Results indicate that departmental characteristics, positional characteristics, and individual characteristics predict attitudes and behavior, with individual characteristics being the best predictor. By themselves, job characteristics are related most highly to departmental characteristics. Job characteristics associated with organizational position account entirely for the relation of positional characteristics (such as shift) to attitudes and behavior. Job characteristics also account for a substantial part of the relationship of departmental characteristics to attitudes and behavior, but do not explain the relation of individual characteristics to these responses. Finally, this study discusses the need to assess individual perceptions as well as objective characteristics of contexts.},

These organizational units were classified into three technological categories. Significant differences were found between the job characteristics, employee satisfaction, and motivation across technology.

The emergence of genomes, cells, multi-cellular organisms, social insects and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived which specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

  abstract = {A fundamental aspect of all biological systems is cooperation. Cooperative interactions are required for many levels of biological organization ranging from single cells to groups of animals–. Human society is based to a large extent on mechanisms that promote cooperation–. It is well known that in unstructured populations, natural selection favors defectors over cooperators. There is much current interest, however, for studying evolutionary games in structured populations and on graphs–. These efforts recognize the fact that who-meets-whom is not random, but determined by spatial relationships or social networks–. Here we describe a surprisingly simple rule, which is a good approximation for all graphs that we have analyzed, including cycles, spatial lattices, random regular graphs, random graphs and scale-free networks,: natural selection favors cooperation, if the benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the average number of neighbors, k. Therefore, cooperation can evolve as a consequence of ‘social viscosity’ even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity.},

  abstract = {Does cooperating require the inhibition of selfish urges? Or does “rational” self-interest constrain cooperative impulses? I investigated the role of intuition and deliberation in cooperation by meta-analyzing 67 studies in which cognitive-processing manipulations were applied to economic cooperation games (total N = 17,647; no indication of publication bias using Egger’s test, Begg’s test, or p-curve). My meta-analysis was guided by the social heuristics hypothesis, which proposes that intuition favors behavior that typically maximizes payoffs, whereas deliberation favors behavior that maximizes one’s payoff in the current situation. Therefore, this theory predicts that deliberation will undermine pure cooperation (i.e., cooperation in settings where there are few future consequences for one’s actions, such that cooperating is not in one’s self-interest) but not strategic cooperation (i.e., cooperation in settings where cooperating can maximize one’s payoff). As predicted, the meta-analysis revealed 17.3\% more pure cooperation when intuition was promoted over deliberation, but no significant difference in strategic cooperation between more intuitive and more deliberative conditions.},

  abstract = {The public goods game is the classic laboratory paradigm for studying collective action problems. Each participant chooses how much to contribute to a common pool which returns benefits to all participants equally. The ideal outcome is if everybody contributes the maximum amount, but the self-interested strategy is not to contribute anything. Most previous studies have found punishment to be more effective than reward for maintaining cooperation in public goods games. The typical design of these studies, however, represses future consequences for today’s actions. In an experimental setting, we compare public goods games followed by punishment, reward or both in the setting of truly repeated games, where player identities persist from round to round. We show that reward is as effective as punishment for maintaining public cooperation and leads to higher total earnings. Moreover, when both options are available, reward leads to increased contributions and payoff, while punishment has no effect on contributions and leads to lower payoff. We conclude that reward outperforms punishment in repeated public goods games and that human cooperation in such repeated settings is best supported by positive interactions with others.},

The statistical analysis of the APIM is illustrated using                 longitudinal data on relationship specific attachment security from 203                 mother–adolescent dyads. The results support the view that interpersonal                 influence on attachment security is bidirectional. Moreover, consistent with a                 hypothesis from attachment theory, the degree to which a child’s                 attachment security is influenced by his or her primary caregiver is found to                 diminish with age.},

  abstract = {Mediation is a causal process that evolves over time. Thus, a study of mediation requires data collected throughout the process. However, most applications of mediation analysis use cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data. Another implicit assumption commonly made in longitudinal designs for mediation analysis is that the same mediation process universally applies to all members of the population under investigation. This assumption ignores the important issue of ergodicity before aggregating the data across subjects. We first argue that there exists a discrepancy between the concept of mediation and the research designs that are typically used to investigate it. Second, based on the concept of ergodicity, we argue that a given mediation process probably is not equally valid for all individuals in a population. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose a two-faceted solution. The first facet of the solution is that we advocate a single-subject time-series design that aligns data collection with researchers' conceptual understanding of mediation. The second facet is to introduce a flexible statistical method—the state space model—as an ideal technique to analyze single-subject time series data in mediation studies. We provide an overview of the state space method and illustrative applications using both simulated and real time series data. Finally, we discuss additional issues related to research design and modeling.},

Various indexes which can be used in the quantification of these constructs are also presented. Two examples which illustrate the calculation of some of the indexes for a relatively simple task and a relatively complex task are presented and the relationship between task complexity and task performance is briefly discussed.},

Although male and female infants did not differ in birth length, weight, or Apgar scores, daughters were significantly more likely than sons to be described as little, beautiful, pretty, and cute, and as resembling their mothers. Fathers made more extreme and stereotyped rating judgments of their newborns than did mothers. Findings suggest that sex-typing and sex-role socialization have already begun at birth.

  abstract = {Sex differences in children’s toy preferences are thought by many to arise from gender socialization. However, evidence from patients with endocrine disorders suggests that biological factors during early development (e.g., levels of androgens) are influential. In this study, we found that vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) show sex differences in toy preferences similar to those documented previously in children. The percent of contact time with toys typically preferred by boys (a car and a ball) was greater in male vervets (n = 33) than in female vervets (n = 30) ( P {$<$} .05), whereas the percent of contact time with toys typically preferred by girls (a doll and a pot) was greater in female vervets than in male vervets ( P {$<$} .01). In contrast, contact time with toys preferred equally by boys and girls (a picture book and a stuffed dog) was comparable in male and female vervets. The results suggest that sexually differentiated object preferences arose early in human evolution, prior to the emergence of a distinct hominid lineage. This implies that sexually dimorphic preferences for features (e.g., color, shape, movement) may have evolved from differential selection pressures based on the different behavioral roles of males and females, and that evolved object feature preferences may contribute to present day sexually dimorphic toy preferences in children.

Explanations of the motivation to punish generally rely either on small group size or on a Folk theorem that requires coordinated punishment and, hence, highly accurate information concerning the behavior of each player. We provide a model of team production in which the punishment of shirkers depends on strong reciprocity: the willingness of some team members to contribute altruistically to a joint project and also to bear costs in order to discipline fellow members who do not contribute. This alternative does not require small group size, complex coordinated punishing activities, or implausible informational assumptions. An experimental public goods game provides evidence for the behavioral relevance of strong reciprocity and how it differs from unconditional altruism.},

  abstract = {Most, if not all, workplace phenomena are dynamic, meaning that they emerge, evolve, and dissolve over time. Yet, the role of time is commonly overlooked in OB literature. This special issue showcases how a temporal process-oriented lens can be used to study dynamics of workplace phenomena. In this editorial, we define the term dynamics, arguing that research on workplace dynamics focuses on how within-person (or more broadly, within-unit) processes unfold over time. Moreover, we zoom in on the diverse roles of time, illustrating the rich diversity in research on workplace dynamics, and we highlight three specific challenges for scholars wanting to pursue this line of research. We conclude that the time has come to move from a differential to a temporal and process-oriented perspective, allowing us to understand what happens, how things happen, and why things happen at the workplace.},

The behavior of an organizational member is seen as a function of the reinforcement contingencies applied by various groups in his environment and of his cognitive assessment of such contingencies. Several characteristics of reinforcement contingencies are examined, e.g., positive vs negative reinforcement, schedules of reinforcement, and immediacy of reinforcement. The model provides a potentially useful schema for classifying environmental contingencies operating on a member of an organization and for predicting their varied effects on behavior.},

  abstract = {The behavior analysis approach was used to improve worker safety in 2 departments in a food manufacturing plant. Desired safety practices were identified, permitting construction of observational codes suitable for observing workers' on-the-job performance over a 25-week period of time. The intervention consisted of an explanation and visual presentation of the desired behaviors, as well as frequent, low-cost reinforcement in the form of feedback. A within-subject (multiple baseline) design was used. Employees in the 2 departments substantially improved their safety performance from 70\% and 78\% to 96\% and 99\% in the wrapping and makeup departments, respectively, after the staggered introduction of the program. During the reversal phase, performance returned to baseline (71\% and 72\%). It was concluded that the intervention, particularly the frequent feedback, was effective in improving safety performance. Not only did employees react favorably to the program, but the company was later able to maintain the program with a continuing decline in the injury frequency rate. The results suggest that behaviorally defining and positively reinforcing safe practices is a visible approach to the occupational accident reduction.},

A total of 165 observations were conducted over 45 wks. A multiple-baseline design with a reversal component was used in which 5 conditions were introduced: (a) baseline, (b) Training Only 1 (desired practices were discussed, illustrated, and posted), (c) Training and Feedback 1 (supervisors observed daily and provided feedback about the section safety level on graphs), (d) Training Only 2, and (e) Training and Feedback 2. Whereas employees showed only slight improvements during the Training Only 1 phase, their performance increased substantially during the Training and Feedback 1 phase. At this point, it was concluded that the provision of training alone is not a sufficient means of improving and maintaining performance. This conclusion was confirmed during the Training Only 2 phase when performance declined. Performance improved once again during the Training and Feedback 2 phase, but only when feedback was provided at least 3 times/wk. This qualification raises questions concerning the maintenance of performance gains and supervisory support. (31 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Because of the emphasis on winning, the difficulties involved in assessing performance, and the lack of frequent and contingent reinforcement, a behavioral approach to coaching football was used. The players, all nine- or ten-year-old males, were members of an offensive backfield on a Pop Warner football team. Three frequently-run offensive plays were broken down into a series of five behaviorally defined stages, permitting construction of checklists suitable for observing the players during both game and scrimmage sessions. The intervention consisted of the presentation and explanation of the appropriate checklist, and frequent contingent reinforcement in the form of feedback and recognition for instances of desired play execution. Performance gains averaging 20\% occurred for each of the three plays after, and not before, the staggered introduction of each intervention. The results suggest that behavioral specification and positive reinforcement of desired play execution is a viable approach to the coaching of football.},

Desired goals were described in observable terms, performance repeatedly monitored, and observer reliability assessed. In Experiment I, several potentially reinforcing consequences (time-off with pay, feedback, self-recording) were arranged for desired performance and desired tasks were clarified. A multiple-baseline design across behaviors was employed. The mean performance level of the three behaviors improved from 53, 35, and 57\% to 86, 87, and 86\%, respectively. In Experiment II, a reversal design (ABAB) was used. Performance increased from baseline means of 62 and 63\% to 93 and 97\%, respectively following the introduction of a goal-clarification and contingent pay system. The two studies indicate the potential of the behavior analysis approach for persons involved in the world of work.},

Students' performance is compared under a contingency and a noncontingency condition, using a repeated measures factorial design. Students perform better when they can earn points toward options such as the opportunity to drop low scores, be excused from the final examination, and turn in work for extra credit. It is concluded that events such as these should not be ignored and that they should be considered seriously whenever designing a course.},

Check the scoring key against the survey instrument. 6. Recode so all items purporting to measure the same characteristic are scored in the same direction. 7. Transform scale and item values to be consistent with the scoring key. 8. Know the characteristics of the measuring instruments. 9. Weight scales according to standard scoring procedures. 10.

In the present article, I therefore build on recovery theory and on evidence from chronobiological research and adopt a temporal research approach that allows investigating change trajectories in fatigue over the course of the day. Furthermore, the role of sleep quality and psychological detachment in these change trajectories is investigated. Hypotheses are tested in an experience-sampling study involving 133 employees who were asked to provide fatigue ratings 4 times a day over 5 consecutive workdays. Growth curve analyses revealed that on average fatigue decreased in the morning, reaching a nadir around midday and then increased until bedtime. Additionally, daily sleep quality explained variation in individuals’ fatigue change trajectories: When sleep quality was low, next day fatigue decreased between morning and midday and then increased again until bedtime; when sleep quality was high, fatigue remained stable until midday and then increased again between the end of work and bedtime. Theoretical implications for the recovery literature and practical implications are discussed in conclusion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

This lack of understanding is problematic because burnout is a dynamic phenomenon and burnout interventions may be improved by a greater understanding of who is likely to experience changes in burnout and when these changes occur. In this article, we advance existing burnout theory by articulating how the 3 burnout dimensions should differ in their pattern of change over time as a result of career transition type: organizational newcomers, internal job changers (e.g., promotions or lateral moves), and organizational insiders (i.e., job incumbents). We tested our model in a broad sample of 2,089 health care employees, with 5 measurement points over 2 years. Using random coefficient modeling, we found that burnout was relatively stable for organizational insiders but slightly dynamic for organizational newcomers and internal job changers. We also found that the dimensions of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were more sensitive to career transition type than reduced personal accomplishment. Finding some differences among different types of employees as well as the dimensions of burnout may begin to explain longstanding inconsistencies between theory and research regarding the dynamics of burnout, offering directions for future research that address both dynamism and stability.

A longitudinal model that includes correlations, variances, and means is described as a latent growth curve model (LGM). When merged with repeated-measures data, this technique permits the estimation of parameters representing both individual and group dynamics. The statistical basis of this model allows hypothesis testing of various developmental ideas, including models of alternative dynamic functions and models of the sources of individual differences in these functions. Aspects of these latent growth models are illustrated with a set of longitudinal WISC data from young children and by using the LISREL V computer program.]},

  abstract = {Psychological research has increasingly recognized the importance of integrating temporal dynamics into its theories, and innovations in longitudinal designs and analyses have allowed such theories to be formalized and tested. However, psychological researchers may be relatively unequipped to analyze such data, given its many characteristics and the general complexities involved in longitudinal modeling. The current paper introduces time series analysis to psychological research, an analytic domain that has been essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of variables across many diverse fields. First, the characteristics of time series data are discussed. Second, different time series modeling techniques are surveyed that can address various topics of interest to psychological researchers, including describing the pattern of change in a variable, modeling seasonal effects, assessing the immediate and long-term impact of a salient event, and forecasting future values. To illustrate these methods, an illustrative example based on online job search behavior is used throughout the paper, and a software tutorial in R for these analyses is provided in the Appendix.},

To do so, we first clarify the terminological and conceptual issues that still cloud person-centered approaches. Next, we organize the diverse kinds of person-centered analyses into two major statistical approaches, algorithmic and latent-variable approaches. We then present a literature review that quantifies how these two approaches have been used within our field, identifying trends over time and typical study characteristics. Out of this review, we construct a unifying taxonomy of the five ways in which clusters are differentiated: (1) construct-based patterns, (2) response-style patterns, (3) predictive relations, (4) growth trajectories, and (5) measurement models. We also provide a set of practical guidelines for researchers and highlight a few remaining questions and/or areas in which future work is needed for further advancing person-centered methodologies.},

  abstract = {The two prize winners in Economics this year would describe themselves as “Econometricians, ” so I thought that I should start by explaining that term. One can begin with the ancient subject of Mathematics which is largely concerned with the discovery of relationships between deterministic variables using a rigorous argument. (A deterministic variable is one whose value is known with certainty.) However, by the middle of the last millennium it became clear that some objects were not deterministic, they had to be described with the use of probabilities, so that Mathematics grew a substantial sub-field known as “Statistics. ” This later became involved with the analysis of data and a number of methods have been developed for data having what may be called “standard properties.” However, in some areas of application, the data that they generated were found to be not standard, and so special sub-sub-fields needed to be developed. For example, Biology produced Biometrics, Psychology gave us Psychometrics, and Economics produced Econometrics.},

It is shown that exploratory dynamic factor models can be rotated, yielding an infinite set of equivalent solutions for any observed series. It also is shown that dynamic factor models with lagged factor loadings are not equivalent to the currently popular state-space models, and that restriction of attention to the latter type of models may yield invalid results. The known equivalent vector autoregressive model types, standard and structural, are given a new interpretation in which they are conceived of as the extremes of an innovating type of hybrid vector autoregressive models. It is shown that consideration of hybrid models solves many problems, in particular with Granger causality testing.},

  abstract = {Inferences about the relationships between scores on selection tests and measures of job performance are often made on the basis of an assessment of the match between the content of the test and the content of the job. However, there is little evidence that these test-to-job comparisons have any bearing on the criterion-related validity of selection tests. The authors show that conclusions reached in analyses of cognitive tests—that content matching is largely irrelevant to criterion-related validity—can be generalized to most sets of selection tests (e.g., psychomotor and performance tests, interview ratings, biodata scores, knowledge tests, work sample tests) that are positively correlated with one another and with the criterion. When the universe of potential predictors shows positive manifold, almost all possible sets of test batteries will yield similar outcomes and show similar validities, regardless of whether the content of these tests matches the content of the job.

  abstract = {The use of validated employee selection and promotion procedures is critical to workforce productivity and to the legal defensibility of the personnel decisions made on the basis of those procedures. Consequently, there have been numerous scholarly developments that have considerable implications for the appropriate conduct of criterion-related validity studies. However, there is no single resource researchers can consult to understand how these developments impact practice. The purpose of this article is to summarize and critically review studies published primarily within the past 10 years that address issues pertinent to criterion-related validation. Key topics include (a) validity coefficient correction procedures, (b) the evaluation of multiple predictors, (c) differential prediction analyses, (d) validation sample characteristics, and (e) criterion issues. In each section, we discuss key findings, critique and note limitations of the extant research, and offer conclusions and recommendations for the planning and conduct of criterion-related studies. We conclude by discussing some important but neglected validation issues for which more research is needed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the validity of general cognitive ability tests and personality tests in predicting job performance were estimated, where performance is conceptualized as a composite of multiple performance measures. The validity of a selection battery varies substantially as a function of the relative weight given to both predictors and criteria; the 95\% confidence interval for validities ranged from .20 to .78. The effective weights given to performance dimensions accounted for 34\% of the variance in selection battery validities. The model suggests that the way an organization defines job performance is a source of true and important variability in validities, and that the validity of selection tests for predicting complex performance criteria may show considerably less generalizability than current meta-analysis of univariate validities would suggest.},

Meta-analytic results cumulated from 205 articles indicate that many of these variables hold significant consequences for work analysis data. Factors pertaining to descriptor choice, collection method, rating scale, and the purpose for conducting the work analysis each showed strong associations with work analysis data. The source of the work analysis information and organizational context in which it was conducted displayed fewer relationships.

  abstract = {Growing evidence on the predictive validity of vocational interests for job performance calls for greater consideration of interest assessment in organizations. However, a consensus on the fundamental dimensions of interests that are aligned with the contemporary world of work is still lacking. In the current research, we developed an organizing framework of vocational interests and empirically validated an 8-dimension model (SETPOINT: Health Science, Creative Expression, Technology, People, Organization, Influence, Nature, and Things). We propose that interests are structured hierarchically, with preferences for specific work activities at the lowest level (assessed using interest items), basic interests for homogeneous classes of activities at the intermediate level (assessed using basic interest scales), and broad-band interest dimensions describing general tendencies of individuals to be drawn to or motivated by broad types of work environments at the top. To derive broad-band interest dimensions, it is necessary to base it on a comprehensive range of content-specific basic interest constructs. In Study 1, we conducted an extensive review of existing basic interest scales and developed a new assessment of basic interests with 41 homogeneous scales across two samples. In Study 2, we demonstrated the structural validity of the proposed dimensional model using second-order confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling with a large, diverse sample of working adults and supported its predictive validity for occupational membership in new and traditional sectors of work. We discuss implications from the current findings for building interest theory, using interest assessment for organizational research, and evaluating interest structure with appropriate methods.

  shorttitle = {Initial Impressions},
  abstract = {Nearly all employment interviews, even those considered highly structured, begin with a brief meet-and-greet conversation typically coalescing around non-job-related topics (i.e., rapport building). Although applicants and interviewers often view rapport building as an essential, value-adding component of the interview, it may contaminate interviewers' evaluations of answers to subsequently asked structured questions (Levashina, Hartwell, Morgeson, \& Campion, 2014). Yet research has not determined the extent to which initial impressions developed during rapport building influence subsequent interviewer ratings through job-related interview content versus non-job-related content; whether these effects extend beyond more commonly examined image-related factors that can bias interviewers (i.e., self-presentation tactics); or how these effects are temporally bound when influencing interviewer ratings during the formal structured interview question-and-answer process. Addressing these questions, we integrate interview research with the extant social psychology literature to clarify rapport building's unique effects in the employment interview. In contrast to prior assumptions, findings based on 163 mock interviews suggest that a significant portion of initial impressions' influence overlaps with job-related interview content and, importantly, that these effects are distinct from other image-related constructs. Finally, initial impressions are found to more strongly relate to interviewer evaluations of applicant responses earlier rather than later in the structured interview.

Research into low-fidelity simulations, which has focused primarily on text-based situational judgment tests (SJTs), has shown that such measures (a) can predict a wide range of criteria, doing so with moderate adverse impact, depending on the construct saturation of the items, (b) are no more susceptible to coaching/cheating/retesting effects than many other forms of assessment and far less susceptible than some, and (c) continue to struggle when used to measure a single construct. Practice, by contrast, has moved well beyond text-based SJTs to include multimedia SJTs, online assessment center exercises, and game-like assessments. Because these are perceived more favorably by applicants, the same research dedicated to text-based SJTs is needed to guide development of these newer forms of low-fidelity simulation.},

In the current study (N = 698) we used Bayesian generalizability theory to unconfound all of the possible effects contributing to variance in AC ratings. Our results show that ≤1.11\% of the variance in AC ratings was directly attributable to behavioral dimensions, suggesting that dimension-related effects have no practical impact on the reliability of ACs. Even when taking aggregation level into consideration, effects related to general performance and exercises accounted for almost all of the reliable variance in AC ratings. The implications of these findings for recent dimension- and exercise-based perspectives on ACs are discussed.

We rely on interactionist theories to propose that individual differences in assessing situational demands explain true variance in performance in selection procedures and on the job. Results from 124 individuals in a simulated selection process showed that the assessment of situational demands was related to both selection and job performance. Individual differences in assessing situational demands also contributed to the criterion-related validity of assessment center and structured interview ratings, offering a complementary explanation as to why selection procedures based on the notion of behavioral consistency predict job performance.

  abstract = {Though individual assessments are widely used in selection settings, very little research exists to support their criterion-related validity. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted of 39 individual assessment validation studies. For the current research, individual assessments were defined as any employee selection procedure that involved (a) multiple assessment methods, (b) administered to an individual examinee, and (c) relying on assessor judgment to integrate the information into an overall evaluation of the candidate’s suitability for a job. Assessor recommendations were found to be useful predictors of job performance, although the level of validity varied considerably across studies. Validity tended to be higher for managerial than nonmanagerial occupations and for assessments that included a cognitive ability test. Validity was not moderated by the degree of standardization of the assessment content or by use of multiple assessors for each candidate. However, higher validities were found when the same assessor was used across all candidates than when different assessors evaluated different candidates. These results should be interpreted with caution, given a small number of studies for many of the moderator subgroups as well as considerable evidence of publication bias. These limitations of the available research base highlight the need for additional empirical work to inform individual assessment practices.

Traditional analysis indicated predictive bias by intercept in 45 instances and by slope in 7 instances; the inclusion of an Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery general factor as an additional predictor changed the conclusion in 32 cases for the intercept and in 3 cases for the slope.

Ethical and legal reasons that organizations should be concerned about differential validity/prediction are discussed.

The general conclusion is that available evidence supports the existence of differential validity/prediction in the form of correlation/slope and intercept differences between White and non-White subgroups. Implications for individuals and organizations are outlined, and a future research agenda is proposed highlighting the need for new, better data; new, better methods of testing for differential validity/prediction; and investigation of substantive factors causing differential validity/prediction.},

  abstract = {Several of the most valid predictors used to make employment decisions create a diversity-validity dilemma (Pyburn, Ployhart, \& Kravitz, this issue, 2008). This diversity-validity dilemma can be resolved by (a) reducing adverse impact through a variety of technical steps (Ployhart \& Holtz, this issue, 2008) or (b) using affirmative action to increase representation of the disadvantaged groups. This paper focuses on the second approach. The paper begins with a very brief review of the legal bases of affirmative action and a summary of the research on affirmative action attitudes. This is followed with reviews of research on the ongoing existence of workplace discrimination, the economic impact of affirmative action on target groups and organizations, and stigmatization of target group members by others and by target group members themselves. Most problems with affirmative action apply only or primarily to preference-based forms, so nonpreferential approaches to affirmative action are recommended to increase the attraction, selection, inclusion, and retention of underrepresented group members.

Technical manuals for 47 interest inventories were used, yielding 503,188 respondents. Results showed that men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people, producing a large effect size (d = 0.93) on the Things–People dimension. Men showed stronger Realistic (d = 0.84) and Investigative (d = 0.26) interests, and women showed stronger Artistic (d = −0.35), Social (d = −0.68), and Conventional (d = −0.33) interests. Sex differences favoring men were also found for more specific measures of engineering (d = 1.11), science (d = 0.36), and mathematics (d = 0.34) interests. Average effect sizes varied across interest inventories, ranging from 0.08 to 0.79. The quality of interest inventories, based on professional reputation, was not differentially related to the magnitude of sex differences. Moderators of the effect sizes included interest inventory item development strategy, scoring method, theoretical framework, and sample variables of age and cohort. Application of some item development strategies can substantially reduce sex differences. The present study suggests that interests may play a critical role in gendered occupational choices and gender disparity in the STEM fields.

To extend earlier work on the primacy of applicant pool characteristics for resolving adverse impact, they illustrate the advantages of simultaneous cognitive ability– and personality-based recruiting. Results of an algebraic recruiting model support general recruiting for cognitive ability, combined with recruiting for conscientiousness within the underrepresented group. For realistic recruiting effect sizes, this type of recruiting strategy greatly increases average performance of hires and percentage of hires from the underrepresented group. Further results from a policy-capturing study provide initial guidance on how features of organizational image can attract applicants with particular job-related personalities and abilities, in addition to attracting applicants on the basis of demographic background.

The results of this investigation indicate that this is indeed the case. The authors suggest that the procedure be used as one of a number of potential strategies for addressing the quality-adverse impact problem in settings where estimates of the selection parameters (e.g., validity estimates, predictor intercorrelations, subgroup mean differences on the predictors and criteria) are available from either a local validation study or meta-analytic research.

  abstract = {Personnel selection involves exchanges of information between job market actors (applicants and organizations). These actors do not have an incentive to exchange accurate information about their ability and commitment to the employment relationship unless it is to their advantage. This state of affairs explains numerous phenomena in personnel selection (e.g., faking). Signaling theory describes a mechanism by which parties with partly conflicting interests (and thus an incentive for deception) can nevertheless exchange accurate information. We apply signaling theory to personnel selection, distinguishing between adaptive relationships between applicants and organizations, among applicants, and among organizations. In each case, repeated adaptations and counteradaptations between actors can lead to situations of equilibrium or escalation (arms races). We show that viewing personnel selection as a network of adaptive relationships among job market actors enables an understanding of both classic and underexplored micro- and macro-level selection phenomena and their dynamic interactions.

  abstract = {Past reviews and meta-analyses typically conceptualized and examined selection procedures as holistic entities. We draw on the product design literature to propose a modular approach as a complementary perspective to conceptualizing selection procedures. A modular approach means that a product is broken down into its key underlying components. Therefore, we start by presenting a modular framework that identifies the important measurement components of selection procedures. Next, we adopt this modular lens for reviewing the available evidence regarding each of these components in terms of affecting validity, subgroup differences, and applicant perceptions, as well as for identifying new research directions. As a complement to the historical focus on holistic selection procedures, we posit that the theoretical contributions of a modular approach include improved insight into the isolated workings of the different components underlying selection procedures and greater theoretical connectivity among different selection procedures and their literatures. We also outline how organizations can put a modular approach into operation to increase the variety in selection procedures and to enhance the flexibility in designing them. Overall, we believe that a modular perspective on selection procedures will provide the impetus for programmatic and theory-driven research on the different measurement components of selection procedures.

Campion and Matthew H. Reider were originally incorrect. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Emerging advancements including the exponentially growing availability of computer-collected data and increasingly sophisticated statistical software have led to a “Big Data Movement” wherein organizations have begun attempting to use large-scale data analysis to improve their effectiveness. Yet, little is known regarding how organizations can leverage these advancements to develop more effective personnel selection procedures, especially when the data are unstructured (text-based). Drawing on literature on natural language processing, we critically examine the possibility of leveraging advances in text mining and predictive modeling computer software programs as a surrogate for human raters in a selection context. We explain how to “train” a computer program to emulate a human rater when scoring accomplishment records. We then examine the reliability of the computer’s scores, provide preliminary evidence of their construct validity, demonstrate that this practice does not produce scores that disadvantage minority groups, illustrate the positive financial impact of adopting this practice in an organization (N ∼ 46,000 candidates), and discuss implementation issues. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of using computer scoring to address the adverse impact-validity dilemma. We suggest that it may provide a cost-effective means of using predictors that have comparable validity but have previously been too expensive for large-scale screening.

Indeed, there is little scientific research on innovative assessment methods, leaving human resources (HR) practitioners with no credible evidence to evaluate the utility of such tools. To this end, this article provides an overview of new talent identification tools, using traditional workplace assessment methods as the organizing framework for classifying and evaluating new tools, which are largely technologically enhanced versions of traditional methods.

This mischaracterization grossly oversimplifies a rapidly growing area of research and practice both within and outside of industrial-organizational (I-O) psychology. We agree that situational judgment tests (SJTs) can be considered a type of gamified assessment, and gamification provides a toolkit to make SJTs even more gameful. However, the term gamification refers to a much broader and potentially more impactful set of tools than just SJTs, which are incremental, versatile, and especially valuable to practitioners in an era moving toward business-to-consumer (B2C) assessment models. In this commentary, we contend that gamification is commonly misunderstood and misapplied by I-O psychologists, and our goals are to remedy such misconceptions and to provide a research agenda designed to improve both the science and the practice surrounding gamification of human resource processes.},

Interest in this topic has grown steadily since the watershed Harris volume (1963) and has been reﬂected in other books such as Collins \& Horn (1991), Collins \& Sayer (2001), Gottman (1995), Nagin (2005), Nesselroade \& Baltes (1979), Singer \& Willett (2003a), and von Eye (1990a,b), as well as in countless journal articles. Computing resources are becoming increasingly powerful, and readily available specialized software enables scientists to apply new and highly sophisticated statistical analyses in their work. Some rich longitudinal data sets have been archived and are available to the scientiﬁc public for statistical analysis. Further, creative use of new technology, such as handheld computers and other devices, is making collection of longitudinal data characterized by more frequent and intense measurement increasingly feasible (e.g., Shiffman \& Stone 2006, Walls \& Schafer 2006).},

  shorttitle = {The Effect of the Timing and Spacing of Observations in Longitudinal Studies of Tobacco and Other Drug Use},
  abstract = {This article explores the impact of the temporal design, i.e. the sampling of times of measurement, on the statistical and substantive conclusions drawn from longitudinal biomedical and social science research. It is shown that for a study of a given duration, if observations are spaced too far apart the resulting data can support misleading conclusions, whereas if observations are spaced relatively close together, a much more veridical picture of the process of interest is provided. The application of these ideas in several areas is discussed, including correlation and regression analysis where a variable measured at one time is used to predict a variable measured at a later time; growth curve analyses; and analyses involving stage-sequential processes. We argue that longitudinal designs should relate the choice of timing and spacing of observations in longitudinal studies to characteristics of the processes being measured. In addition, consideration of the possible effects of measurement design on results of statistical analyses may aid in their interpretation. New approaches involving intensive data collection with much shorter measurement intervals, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment, are promising, but are costly and are not suitable for every research question. More information is needed to help guide researchers in their choice of temporal design. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  title = {Studying Time in Organizational Behavior},
  abstract = {This article builds on the call of various authors (e.g. George \& Jones, 2000; Mitchell \& James, 2001; Rousseau \& Fried, 2001) for a better representation of time in theory-building and research in organizational behavior (OB). It proposes a radical temporalist approach to the study of OB which combines a new way of conceptualizing and formulating research questions with an alternative methodology for empirical research. Abandoning the static notion of ‘variable’ the focus is placed on inherently dynamic ‘temporal phenomena’. On the basis of a generic model which assumes phenomena to be temporally bounded, an analytical scheme is proposed which relates the onset, duration and dynamics of phenomenon A to those of phenomenon B. In this way, nine prototypical problem types are defined, all of which center around time. A research strategy is proposed which involves three major steps, i.e. (1) temporal modeling of OB phenomena, (2) the investigation of temporal relationships, and (3) the assessment of constancy and variety over longer time periods. After discussing some general methodological issues (related to time scale, time frame, time grid, observation/recording, and measurement) a number of methods for performing these three types of research are reviewed. They include: descriptive modeling, random coefficient modeling, latent growth modeling, event history analysis, time series analysis, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis. Finally, limitations of the radical temporalist approach and future challenges are discussed.},

Analyses of residualized gain scores found apparently detrimental effects of all corrective actions by parents and professionals on subsequent antisocial behavior and hyperactivity. In contrast, analyses of simple gain scores found only apparently beneficial effects. Temporally reversed analyses yielded the same pattern of results, consistent with selection biases and regression artifacts, not with unidirectional causal effects. The findings were similar for corrective actions by professionals (e.g., Ritalin, psychotherapy) and by parents (physical and nonphysical punishment, scolding/yelling, ‘‘hostile-ineffective’’ parenting). Longitudinal analyses should check for similar artifacts by implementing temporally-reversed analyses and by determining whether causally relevant coefficients would replicate without artifacts biased in their favor.},

Until recently, this literature has been completely isolated from the organizational psychology literature. The purpose of this paper is to further extend the sleep literature into the organizational psychology literature, with a focus on self-regulation in the workplace. I summarize the sleep literature into a model of sleep self-regulation. Next, I highlight initial research in organizational psychology which has drawn from basic sleep physiology research. Following this, I generate new propositions linking sleep to work withdrawal, goal level, incivility, and defection in workplace social dilemmas. Finally, I close with a discussion of methods for conducting sleep research in organizational psychology, as well as some promising areas for future research.},

  abstract = {The goal of this article is to clarify the conceptual, methodological, and practical issues that frequently emerge when conducting longitudinal research, as well as in the journal review process. Using a panel discussion format, the current authors address 13 questions associated with 3 aspects of longitudinal research: conceptual issues, research design, and statistical techniques. These questions are intentionally framed at a general level so that the authors could address them from their diverse perspectives. The authors’ perspectives and recommendations provide a useful guide for conducting and reviewing longitudinal studies in work, aging, and retirement research.},

  abstract = {Across the social sciences, lagged explanatory variables are a common strategy to confront challenges to causal identiﬁcation using observational data. We show that “lag identiﬁcation”—the use of lagged explanatory variables to solve endogeneity problems—is an illusion: lagging independent variables merely moves the channel through which endogeneity biases causal estimates, replacing a “selection on observables” assumption with an equally untestable “no dynamics among unobservables” assumption. We build our argument intuitively using directed acyclic graphs, then provide analytical results on the bias resulting from lag identiﬁcation in a simple linear regression framework. We then present simulation results that characterize how, even under favorable conditions, lag identiﬁcation leads to incorrect inferences. These ﬁndings have important implications for current practice among applied researchers in political science, economics, and related disciplines. We conclude by specifying the conditions under which lagged explanatory variables are appropriate for identifying causal eﬀects.},

Using meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 17 CLP design studies, and analyze their results using SEM. Results support that team cohesion and performance are related reciprocally with each other over time. We then used longitudinal data from 205 members of 57 student teams who competed in a complex business simulation over 10 weeks, to test: (a) whether team cohesion and performance were related reciprocally over multiple time periods, (b) the relative magnitude of those relationships, and (c) whether they were stable over time. We also considered the influence of team members’ academic competence and degree of shared leadership on these dynamics. As anticipated, cohesion and performance were related positively, and reciprocally, over time. However, the cohesion ¡ performance relationship was significantly higher than the performance ¡ cohesion relationship. Moreover, the cohesion ¡ performance relationship grew stronger over time whereas the performance ¡ cohesion relationship remained fairly consistent over time. As expected, shared leadership related positively to team cohesion but not directly to their performance; whereas average team member academic competence related positively to team performance but was unrelated to team cohesion. Finally, we conducted and report a replication using a second sample of students competing in a business simulation. Our earlier substantive relationships were mostly replicated, and we illustrated the dynamic temporal properties of shared leadership. We discuss these findings in terms of theoretical importance, applied implications, and directions for future research.},

With a longitudinal sample of 179 teams at Time 1 and 154 teams at Time 2, the authors tested their predictions using a combined polynomial regression and response surface analyses approach. The results supported the authors’ predictions. When team managers and team members’ perceptions of organizational support were high and in agreement, outcomes were maximized. When team managers and team members disagreed, team negative affect increased and team performance and team positive affect decreased. The negative effects of disagreement were most amplified when managers perceived that the team received higher levels of support than did the team itself.},

Three‐person teams performed 9 scenarios of a firefighting simulation distributed over 3 days with discontinuous task changes introduced in the fourth and seventh scenarios (N = 41 teams; 123 individuals). We applied pattern detection algorithm software to the behavioral data to identify emergent performative patterns in the team members' task‐oriented actions. We also used discontinuous growth modeling to track the development of these team action patterns and their dynamic relation to team effectiveness. The results indicate that pattern emergence increased over time. This was particularly true for teams with similar taskwork mental models, and these teams also showed a more acute decrease in action patterns after a task change. In addition, team action patterns became increasingly positively related to team effectiveness over time, but this effect was reset after the occurrence of a task change. Overall, our research provides practical guidance to managers by illustrating the value of teams having highly shared taskwork team mental models and of enhancing the effects of teams' action patterns on team adaptive outcomes.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of alexithymia [as measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)-26, German version] on affective correlates in a dyadic therapeutic interaction (as recorded by the Emotional Facial Action Coding System). Interviews with 12 in-patients with various psychosomatic disorders (anxiety, depression, somatisation) were videotaped and evaluated for facial affect display. The corresponding emotional reactions of the therapists (split screen) were recorded separately. Patients with high alexithymia scores (TAS-26 total score) tended to display less aggressive affects than those with low scores. The therapists’ predominant emotional reaction to alexithymic patients was contempt. Our ﬁndings underscore the deep-rooted nature of alexithymia as a disorder of affect regulation. Since facial affects play a major role in the regulation of emotional interaction, this disorder may evoke negative reactions of potential caregivers.},

They lack systematic and efficient ways of incorporating behavioral observations that are strong indicators of psychological disorder, much of which may occur outside the awareness of either individual. We compared clinical diagnosis of major depression with automatically measured facial actions and vocal prosody in patients undergoing treatment for depression. Manual FACS coding, active appearance modeling (AAM) and pitch extraction were used to measure facial and vocal expression. Classifiers using leave-one-out validation were SVM for FACS and for AAM and logistic regression for voice. Both face and voice demonstrated moderate concurrent validity with depression. Accuracy in detecting depression was 88\% for manual FACS and 79\% for AAM. Accuracy for vocal prosody was 79\%. These findings suggest the feasibility of automatic detection of depression, raise new issues in automated facial image analysis and machine learning, and have exciting implications for clinical theory and practice.},

Depressed participants were followed over the course of treatment and video recorded during a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions were analyzed from the video using both manual and automatic systems. Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units, and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. For both systems, when symptom severity was high, participants made more facial expressions associated with contempt, smiled less, and those smiles that occurred were more likely to be accompanied by facial actions associated with contempt. These results are consistent with the “social risk hypothesis” of depression. According to this hypothesis, when symptoms are severe, depressed participants withdraw from other people in order to protect themselves from anticipated rejection, scorn, and social exclusion. As their symptoms fade, participants send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and produced the same pattern of depression effects suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready for use in behavioral and clinical science.},

Furthermore, raters watched the synchronously recorded video versions of the subject's face and rated them as to expressivity. The findings indicate that depressive and schizophrenic patients exhibited reduced facial activity in the upper part of their face in social interaction conditions. Schizophrenic patients showed reduced facial action responsivitiy across different conditions and emotions. All patients were judged to be less expressive than normal controls by raters, suggesting apparent disintegrated elements in facial activity, although when computer-analysed they exhibited the same amount of facial activity.},

  abstract = {The cross-sectional research design, especially when used with self-report surveys, is held in low esteem despite its widespread use. It is generally accepted that the longitudinal design offers considerable advantages and should be preferred due to its ability to shed light on causal connections. In this paper, I will argue that the ability of the longitudinal design to reflect causality has been overstated and that it offers limited advantages over the cross-sectional design in most cases in which it is used. The nature of causal inference from a philosophy of science perspective is used to illustrate how cross-sectional designs can provide evidence for relationships among variables and can be used to rule out many potential alternative explanations for those relationships. Strategies for optimizing the use of cross-sectional designs are noted, including the inclusion of control variables to rule out spurious relationships, the addition of alternative sources of data, and the incorporation of experimental methods. Best practice advice is offered for the use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as for authors writing and for reviewers evaluating papers that report results of cross-sectional studies.},

  shorttitle = {Affective Computing Using Speech and Eye Gaze},
  abstract = {Speech has been a widely used modality in the field of affective computing. Recently however, there has been a growing interest in the use of multi-modal affective computing systems. These multi-modal systems incorporate both verbal and non-verbal features for affective computing tasks. Such multi-modal affective computing systems are advantageous for emotion assessment of individuals in audio-video communication environments such as teleconferencing, healthcare, and education. From a review of the literature, the use of eye gaze features extracted from video is a modality that has remained largely unexploited for continuous affect prediction. This work presents a review of the literature within the emotion classification and continuous affect prediction sub-fields of affective computing for both speech and eye gaze modalities. Additionally, continuous affect prediction experiments using speech and eye gaze modalities are presented. A baseline system is proposed using open source software, the performance of which is assessed on a publicly available audio-visual corpus. Further system performance is assessed in a cross-corpus and cross-lingual experiment. The experimental results suggest that eye gaze is an effective supportive modality for speech when used in a bimodal continuous affect prediction system. The addition of eye gaze to speech in a simple feature fusion framework yields a prediction improvement of 6.13\% for valence and 1.62\% for arousal.},

  abstract = {We introduce ctsem, an R package for continuous time structural equation modeling of panel (N {$>$} 1) and time series (N = 1) data, using full information maximum likelihood. Most dynamic models (e.g., cross-lagged panel models) in the social and behavioural sciences are discrete time models. An assumption of discrete time models is that time intervals between measurements are equal, and that all subjects were assessed at the same intervals. Violations of this assumption are often ignored due to the diﬃculty of accounting for varying time intervals, therefore parameter estimates can be biased and the time course of eﬀects becomes ambiguous. By using stochastic diﬀerential equations to estimate an underlying continuous process, continuous time models allow for any pattern of measurement occasions. By interfacing to OpenMx, ctsem combines the ﬂexible speciﬁcation of structural equation models with the enhanced data gathering opportunities and improved estimation of continuous time models. ctsem can estimate relationships over time for multiple latent processes, measured by multiple noisy indicators with varying time intervals between observations. Within and between eﬀects are estimated simultaneously by modeling both observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. Exogenous shocks with diﬀerent shapes, group diﬀerences, higher order diﬀusion eﬀects and oscillating processes can all be simply modeled. We ﬁrst introduce and deﬁne continuous time models, then show how to specify and estimate a range of continuous time models using ctsem.},

  abstract = {A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36\% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77\% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95\% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers’ intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We ﬁrst outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider deﬁnitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

  abstract = {Longitudinal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in the behavioral sciences, with key advantages including increased power, more comprehensive measurement, and establishment of temporal precedence. One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a timevarying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model. Existing analytic methods are reviewed, a general approach to the problem is proposed, and both the existing and proposed methods are demonstrated using several artificial data sets. Potential limitations and directions for future research are discussed, and recommendations for the disaggregation of effects in practice are offered.},

  abstract = {Objective: Although recent statistical and computational developments allow for the empirical testing of psychological theories in ways not previously possible, one particularly vexing challenge remains: how to optimally model the prospective, reciprocal relations between 2 constructs as they developmentally unfold over time. Several analytic methods currently exist that attempt to model these types of relations, and each approach is successful to varying degrees. However, none provide the unambiguous separation over time of between-person and within-person components of stability and change, components that are often hypothesized to exist in the psychological sciences. Our goal in this article is to propose and demonstrate a novel extension of the multivariate latent curve model to allow for the disaggregation of these effects. Method: We begin with a review of the standard latent curve models and describe how these primarily capture between-person differences in change. We then extend this model to allow for regression structures among the time-specific residuals to capture within-person differences in change. Results: We demonstrate this model using an artificial data set generated to mimic the developmental relation between alcohol use and depressive symptomatology spanning 5 repeated measures. Conclusions: We obtain a specificity of results from the proposed analytic strategy that is not available from other existing methodologies. We conclude with potential limitations of our approach and directions for future research.},

We demonstrate that four popular variants of the latent change score model – the no change, constant change, proportional change, and dual change models – have LGM equivalents. We provide equations that allow the translation of parameters from one approach to the other and vice versa. We then illustrate this equivalence using mathematics achievement data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.},

The secondary goal is to point out some differences. We begin with a brief review of both approaches, before demonstrating how the 2 methods are mathematically and conceptually related. It will be shown that most commonly used latent change score models are related to continuous time models by the difference equation approximation to the differential equation. One way in which the 2 approaches differ is the treatment of time. Whereas there are theoretical and practical restrictions regarding observation time points and intervals in latent change score models, no such limitations exist in continuous time models. We illustrate our arguments with three simulated data sets using a univariate and bivariate model with equal and unequal time intervals. As a by-product of this comparison, we discuss the use of phantom and deﬁnition variables to account for varying time intervals in latent change score models. We end with a reanalysis of the Bradway–McArdle longitudinal study on intellectual abilities (used before by McArdle \& Hamagami, 2004) by means of the proportional change score model and the dual change score model in discrete and continuous time.},

We then apply these methods to examining sex differences in the development of binge drinking behavior through adolescence and into adulthood. Advances in growth modeling methods are then discussed and include inherently nonlinear growth models, derivative speciﬁcation of growth models, and latent change score models to study stochastic change processes.

This calls for more and better use of dynamic modeling in OPOB research than before. The goals of this review are to provide an overview of the general forms of dynamic modeling in OPOB research, discuss three longitudinal data analytic techniques for conducting dynamic modeling with empirical data [i.e., time-series-based modeling, latent-change-scores-based modeling, and functional data analysis (FDA)], and introduce various dynamic modeling approaches for building theories about dynamic phenomena and processes (i.e., agent-based modeling, system dynamics modeling, and hybrid modeling). This review also highlights several OPOB research areas to which dynamic modeling has been applied and discusses future research directions for better utilizing dynamic modeling in those areas.},

This result occurs in a simple model in which performance is not frequency dependent, there are no delayed eﬀects, and skill is unrelated to risk-taking. The performance of an agent in any given period equals a skill component plus a noise term. We show that the average skill of survivors eventually decreases when the noise terms in consecutive periods are dependent and drawn from a distribution with a “long” tail—a sub-class of heavy-tailed distributions. This result occurs because only agents with extremely high level of performance survive many periods, and extreme performance is not diagnostic of high skill when the noise term is drawn from a long-tailed distribution.},

  abstract = {Existing explanations of reference-dependent risk sensitivity attribute it to cognitive imperfections and heuristic choice processes. This article shows that behavior consistent with an S-shaped value function could be an implication of rational inferences about the expected values of alternatives. Theoretically, I demonstrate that even a risk-neutral Bayesian decision maker, who is uncertain about the reliability of observations, should use variability in observed outcomes as a predictor of low expected value for outcomes above a reference level, and as a predictor of high expected value for outcomes below a reference level. Empirically, I show that combining past outcomes using an S-shaped value function leads to accurate predictions about future values. The theory also offers a rationale for why risk sensitivity consistent with an inverse S-shaped value function should occur in experiments on decisions from experience with binary payoff distributions.

Some empirical duration distributions have bimodal hazard rates, however. In this paper, we present a generalization of the performance sampling model that can account for such deviations from unimodality. While the standard model of performance sampling assumes that the mean and the standard deviation of performance are constant over time, we allow them to change in time, to reflect the fact that tasks may change over time. We derive the hazard rate implied by this more general model and show that it can be bimodal. Using data on turnover in law firms, we show that the hazard rate predicted by these models fit data better than existing models.},

We use fundamentals of research on creativity and innovation as a lens through which we can view problems and possible solutions to these problems. In particular, we stress that innovation entails not only new, but also useful insights, that innovation requires “rewarding failure”, and that innovation feeds off of team diversity. We provide suggestions for how the definition of theoretical and empirical contributions of research, reward systems, and collaboration practices could be changed to foster innovative research that helps people thrive at work.},

  abstract = {Despite the lengthy history of team cohesion–performance research, little is known about their reciprocal relationships over time. Using meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 17 CLP design studies, and analyze their results using SEM. Results support that team cohesion and performance are related reciprocally with each other over time. We then used longitudinal data from 205 members of 57 student teams who competed in a complex business simulation over 10 weeks, to test: (a) whether team cohesion and performance were related reciprocally over multiple time periods, (b) the relative magnitude of those relationships, and (c) whether they were stable over time. We also considered the influence of team members’ academic competence and degree of shared leadership on these dynamics. As anticipated, cohesion and performance were related positively, and reciprocally, over time. However, the cohesion → performance relationship was significantly higher than the performance → cohesion relationship. Moreover, the cohesion → performance relationship grew stronger over time whereas the performance → cohesion relationship remained fairly consistent over time. As expected, shared leadership related positively to team cohesion but not directly to their performance; whereas average team member academic competence related positively to team performance but was unrelated to team cohesion. Finally, we conducted and report a replication using a second sample of students competing in a business simulation. Our earlier substantive relationships were mostly replicated, and we illustrated the dynamic temporal properties of shared leadership. We discuss these findings in terms of theoretical importance, applied implications, and directions for future research.

In this paper, we introduce a nomothetic perspective of job stress. The nomothetic perspective assumes that despite individual differences there will be consistencies in how groups of individuals perceive and respond to similar work environments. To contrast the individual and nomothetic perspectives, we analyzed data from 7,382 respondents from 99 groups. In the analyses, we examined individual-and group-level relationships using both real groups and randomly formed groups. The results revealed that respondents from the same work group agreed about perceptions of the work climate. The results also revealed that both individual and nomothetic perspectives were useful in describing the relationship between cohesion and psychological well-being. The relationship between work hours and psychological well-being, however, was best modeled from a nomothetic perspective.},

Undergraduate male volunteers were randomly assigned to 3-man basketball teams and teams were randomly assigned to receive either a cohesion-producing or a cohesion-reducing manipulation before competing. Level of cohesion and individual as well as team performance variables were assessed prior to and after each game. The manipulation successfully created teams higher and lower in cohesion. The results indicate that cohesion had a negligible impact on team performance. A stronger effect was found for the impact of performance on cohesion with winning teams having higher levels of cohesion than losing teams. These findings are consistent with previous literature and lend experimental support to the conclusion that performance has more impact on cohesion than cohesion has on performance.},

  abstract = {Although much is known about the harmful eﬀects of perceived discrimination on employees’ psychological wellbeing, surprisingly few studies have examined why some individuals with stigmatized identities are able to rise above and overcome the eﬀects of prejudicial work events. To address this gap in the literature, we integrate existing theory and research on workplace discrimination, mindfulness, and paranoid cognition to develop and test a dynamic, within-person moderated mediation model that explains why some employees are able to interrupt the process through which perceptions of discrimination lead to emotional exhaustion the next workday. Speciﬁcally, an experience sampling study conducted over two workweeks utilizing a sample of 105 transgender employees revealed that perceptions of discrimination predicted greater emotional exhaustion the following morning at work via heightened levels of paranoid cognition. However, trait mindfulness moderated this indirect within-person eﬀect, such that individuals higher on mindfulness reported less paranoid cognition the morning after reporting discrimination at work and, in turn, were less emotionally depleted. By integrating the concept of mindfulness into the discrimination literature and examining the mediating role of paranoid cognition, the present study sheds light on one avenue by which employees with stigmatized identities are able to “weather the storm” of prejudicial experiences at work and has a number of key implications for future research on workplace discrimination, mindfulness, and paranoia.},

However, the issue of how well-being evolves after individuals switch back into the labor force has received little theoretical and empirical attention. This study examines the extent to which reemployment restores individuals’ subjective well-being following a period of unemployment. Applying fixed effects models to the large-scale longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey, we find that recovery of subjective well-being upon reemployment is fast, complete and enduring, even when individuals take less favorable employment options to return to work. By contrast, transitions into economic inactivity following unemployment are accompanied by persistent scars on subsequent wellbeing trajectories. This study advances our understanding of well-being development over the entire employment– unemployment–reemployment cycle.},

  abstract = {In this work we develop and apply a class of hierarchical directed graphical models on the task of recognizing affective categories from prosody in both acted and natural speech. A strength of this new approach is the integration and summarization of information using both local (e.g., syllable level) and global prosodic phenomena (e.g., utterance level). In this framework speech is structurally modeled as a dynamically evolving hierarchical model in which levels of the hierarchy are determined by prosodic constituency and contain parameters that evolve according to dynamical systems. The acoustic parameters have been chosen to reflect four main components of speech thought to reflect paralinguistic and affect-specific information: intonation, loudness, rhythm and voice quality. The work is first evaluated on a database of acted emotions and compared to human perceptual recognition of five affective categories where it achieves rates within nearly 10\% of human recognition accuracy despite only focusing on prosody. The model is then evaluated on two different corpora of fully spontaneous, affectively-colored, naturally occurring speech between people: Call Home English and BT Call Center. Here the ground truth labels are obtained from examining the agreement of 29 human coders labeling arousal and valence. The best discrimination performance on the natural spontaneous speech, using only the prosody features, obtains a 70\% detection rate with 30\% false alarms when detecting high arousal negative valence speech in call centers.},

  abstract = {Automatic emotion recognition from speech has received an increasing amount of interest in recent years, and many speech emotion recognition methods have been presented, in which the training and testing procedures are often conducted on the same corpus. However, in practice, the training and testing speech utterances are collected from different conditions or devices, which will have adverse effects on recognition performance. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel cross-corpus speech emotion recognition method, called transfer non-negative matrix factorization (TNMF) is proposed. Specifically, the NMF approach, which is popular in computer vision and pattern recognition fields, is utilized to obtain low dimensional representations of emotional features. Meanwhile, the discrepancies between source and target data sets are considered, and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) algorithm is used for similarity measurement. Then, the TNMF method, which jointly optimizes the NMF and MMD algorithms, is presented. Moreover, to further improve the recognition performance, two variants of TNMF, called transfer graph regularized NMF (TGNMF) and transfer constrained NMF (TCNMF), are proposed, respectively. Several experiments are carried out on three popular emotional databases, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our scheme.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to select a set of higher order spectral features for emotion/stress recognition system. 50 Bispectral (28 features) and Bicoherence (22 features) based higher order spectral features were extracted from speech signal and its glottal waveform. These features were combined with Inter-Speech 2010 features to further improve the recognition rates. Feature subset selection (FSS) was carried out in this proposed work with the objective of maximizing emotion recognition rate for subject independent with minimum features. The FSS contains two stages: Multi-cluster feature selection was adopted in Stage 1 to reduce feature space and identify relevant feature subset from Interspeech 2010 features. In Stage 2, Biogeography based optimization (BBO), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and proposed BBO\_PSO Hybrid optimization were performed to further reduce the dimension of feature space and identify the most relevant feature subset, which has higher discrimination ability to distinguish different emotional states. The proposed method was tested in three different databases: Berlin emotional speech database (BES), Surrey audio-visual expressed emotion database (SAVEE) and Speech under simulated and actual stress (SUSAS) simulated domain. The proposed feature set was evaluated with subject independent (SI), subject dependent (SD), gender dependent male (GD-male), gender dependent female (GD-female), text independent pairwise speech (TIDPS), and text independent multi-style speech (TIDMSS) experiments by using SVM and ELM classifiers. From the results obtained, it is evident that the proposed method attained accuracies of 93.25\% (SI), 100\% (SD), 93.75\% (GD-male), and 97.58\% (GD-female) for BES; 62.38\% (SI) and 76.19\% (SD) for SAVEE; and 90.09\% (TIDMSS), 97.04\% (TIDPS − Angry vs. Neutral), 98.89\% (TIDPS − Lombard vs. Neutral), 99.07\% (TIDPS − Loud vs. Neutral) for SUSAS.},

The proposed model has four main parts including thalamus, sensory cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. As this model is inspired from human brain, ANFIS has been used in this study to develop a model in subsystems of amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to make rules. To classify the rate of speech emotion signals, the ANFIS outputs are given to MLP network. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a powerful capability to identify a human’s speech emotion.},

This rotation dramatically simpliﬁes ﬁt evaluation in a way that becomes more potent as the size of the data set increases. We validate and evaluate the implementation using a 3-level latent regression simulation study. Then we analyze data from a statewide child behavioral health measure administered by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of Rampart compared to other similar software using a latent factor model with a 5-level decomposition of latent variance.

  abstract = {We present a novel audiovisual emotion recognition solution using multimodal information fusion based on entropy estimation. Considering the limitations of existing methods, we propose a new dual-level fusion framework which consists of feature level fusion module based on kernel entropy component analysis and score level fusion module based on maximum correntropy criterion. In our system, audio and visual channels are utilized to detect and classify emotional states for intelligent human computer interfaces. Our extensive experimental study on eNTERFACE database and RML database demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed multimodal emotion recognition framework based on integrated analysis of speech and facial expression. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are capable of providing improved performance. The comparison with other methods shows that the proposed twostage fusion platform outperforms the traditional algorithms in terms of both accuracy and reliability.},

  abstract = {MAHNOB-HCI is a multimodal database recorded in response to affective stimuli with the goal of emotion recognition and implicit tagging research. A multimodal setup was arranged for synchronized recording of face videos, audio signals, eye gaze data, and peripheral/central nervous system physiological signals. Twenty-seven participants from both genders and different cultural backgrounds participated in two experiments. In the first experiment, they watched 20 emotional videos and self-reported their felt emotions using arousal, valence, dominance, and predictability as well as emotional keywords. In the second experiment, short videos and images were shown once without any tag and then with correct or incorrect tags. Agreement or disagreement with the displayed tags was assessed by the participants. The recorded videos and bodily responses were segmented and stored in a database. The database is made available to the academic community via a web-based system. The collected data were analyzed and single modality and modality fusion results for both emotion recognition and implicit tagging experiments are reported. These results show the potential uses of the recorded modalities and the significance of the emotion elicitation protocol.},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been a large body of theoretical work examining how local competition can reduce and even remove selection for altruism between relatives. However, it is less well appreciated that local competition favours selection for spite, the relatively neglected ugly sister of altruism. Here, we use extensions of social evolution theory that were formulated to deal with the consequences for altruism of competition between social partners, to illustrate several points on the evolution of spite. Speciﬁcally, we show that: (i) the conditions for the evolution of spite are less restrictive than previously assumed; (ii) previous models which have demonstrated selection for spite often implicitly assumed local competition; (iii) the scale of competition must be allowed for when distinguishing different forms of spite (Hamiltonian vs. Wilsonian); (iv) local competition can enhance the spread of spiteful greenbeards; and (v) the theory makes testable predictions for how the extent of spite should vary dependent upon population structure and average relatedness.},

One reason for this persistent research gap could be that organizational scholars are not aware of the methodological advances that are available today for modeling temporal interactions and detecting behavioral patterns that emerge over time. To facilitate such awareness, this Methods Corner contribution provides a hands-on tutorial for capturing and quantifying temporal behavioral patterns and for leveraging rich interaction data in organizational settings. We provide an overview of different approaches and methodologies for examining temporal interaction patterns, along with detailed information about the type of data that needs to be gathered in order to apply each method as well as the analytical steps (and available software options) involved in each method. Specifically, we discuss and illustrate lag sequential analysis, pattern analysis, statistical discourse analysis, and visualization methods for identifying temporal patterns in interaction data. We also provide key takeaways for integrating these methods more firmly in the field of organizational research and for moving interaction analytical research forward.},

We begin with a useful general description of what open science in organizational research represents and adopt a question-and-answer format. Through this format, we then focus on the application of specific open science practices and explore future directions of open science. All of this builds up to a series of specific actionable recommendations provided in conclusion, to help individual researchers, reviewers, journal editors, and other stakeholders develop a more open research environment and culture.},

Cumulative culture is often explained by appeal to a combination of high-fidelity social learning and innovation, the “ratchet 10 effect.” What is often overlooked is that both human and other animal culture is supported by a more primary ratchet effect that retains and increases the prevalence of adaptive behavior. This primary ratchet can arise without appeal to specialized cognitive adaptations and is plausibly more widespread in animal societies. We use a simple model to highlight how simple forms of contingent social learning can cre15 ate the primary ratchet effect, dramatically increasing the prevalence of adaptive, hard to invent behavior. We investigate some ways that demography may interact with the primary ratchet to generate patterns of cultural variation. As the primary ratchet may be common to many animal societies, its cognitive components and population dynamics provide a common foundation for the study of animal culture and 20 a necessary foundation for understanding the origins of human cumulative culture.},

  abstract = {This article is a primer on issues in designing, testing, and interpreting interaction or moderator effects in research on family psychology. The ﬁrst section focuses on procedures for testing and interpreting simple effects and interactions, as well as common errors in testing moderators (e.g., testing differences among subgroup correlations, omitting components of products, and using median splits). The second section, devoted to difﬁculties in detecting interactions, covers such topics as statistical power, measurement error, distribution of variables, and mathematical constraints of ordinal interactions. The third section, devoted to design issues, focuses on recommendations such as including reliable measures, enhancing statistical power, and oversampling extreme scores. The topics covered should aid understanding of existing moderator research as well as improve future research on interaction effects.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in theories and data collection methods have made intensive longitudinal data (ILD) increasingly relevant and available for organizational research. New methods for analyzing ILD have emerged under the multilevel modeling framework. In this article, we first delineate features of ILD (including autoregressive relationships, trends, cycles/seasons, and between-subject variability in temporal trends). We discuss the analytic challenges for handling ILD using traditional analytic tools familiar to organizational researchers (e.g., growth models, single-subject time series analyses). We then introduce a statistical approach for handling ILD from the multilevel modeling framework: dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM). We provide three examples using simulated data sets to demonstrate how to apply DSEM to examine ILD with a software program familiar to organizational researchers (i.e., Mplus). Finally, we discuss issues related to applying DSEM, including centering, missing data, and sample size.},

Towards the end, we attempt to provide glimpses of the vast literature published on the topic, which should be helpful to someone aspiring to go into the depth of the methodology. A section is dedicated to illustrate real data examples. We think the selected set of references cover the greater part of the developments on this subject matter.},

Discussion focuses on the application of these models for understanding the dynamics of individuals interacting in their organizations.},
